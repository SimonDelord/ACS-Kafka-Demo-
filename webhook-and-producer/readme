This repo contains the code for the webhook and producer microservice.
As part of the setup of this component, the variables are:
- the bootstrap server (for the kafka environment)
- the topic name 
- the url for the webhook (default is simply /).

For the url component, I use Flask and if I keep the default and expose it on port 8001 for the following cluster - rosa-f54xw.wvqh.p1.openshiftapps.com
when I create a route for this environment the url is at http://acs-webhook-kafka.apps.rosa-f54xw.wvqh.p1.openshiftapps.com

  If I change the route to /webhook the url will become http://acs-webhook-kafka.apps.rosa-f54xw.wvqh.p1.openshiftapps.com/webhook
